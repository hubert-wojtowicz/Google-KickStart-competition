# What is this repo about

- This repo is my journey with [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) algorithmic competition.
- This repo is also start of my journey with Python 3 language.

# Target platform

As [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) indicate [here](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/faq#what-are-the-stack-size-limits) those python 3 programs should be run according to specified platform version:

```
3.5.3 (package: python3.5)
 numpy 1.16.2 (pip install numpy)
 scipy 1.2.1 (pip install scipy)
 python3.5 Solution.py
```
You can download [python3.5.3 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-353/)

# Comparing to solutuins of others

There are some tasks which I found to be interesting to compare mine solutions with others competitors for sake of in depth learning.
All of those solutions I reffer to are availiable publically on [Kick Start archive](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/archive).
Every time i will referr to others code I will explicitely say the nickname of the author. 

⚠️ WARNING: I want also notice that LICENSE for others code shown in my comparisions remains unchanged.
